# Bootcamp Module 4: Web APIs, Challenge: Coding Quiz

## This project required me to build a coding quiz from scratch. The criteria for the quiz are: a start button that starts a timer and presents the first question, that the next question appears when the current question is answered, that time is deducted from the timer for incorrect answers, that the game is over when all questions are answered or the timer is at zero, and that the player can save their intials and score. 

### This challenge was literally one challenge after another throughout the whole project. The timer, the question reel, the high score list. I did a great deal of searching online. 

### The timer is set up as a setInterval that just counts down and displays the current number. 

### I initially planned the question reel to be a loop. Which I wrestled with for quite a while before I decided to simply make a question index counter and call the function at the end each round. That works well and didn't really seem to increase the size of the code neeeded compared to the loop. 

### Figuring out the high score saving mechanism really required me to get more familiar with storage and how to manipulate the data involved. Good times.

#### My site was built using [Git Hub Pages](https://mcamy2001.github.io/code-quiz/).

#### I can't really list all the different places I searched online while doing this project, there were too many quick searches. The main sites I used for general searches are MDN docs and w3schools. These are other sites I'd note in my research: 
<ul>
  <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k</li>
  <li>https://michael-karen.medium.com/how-to-save-high-scores-in-local-storage-7860baca9d68</li>
</ul>

#### As usual I also need to acknowledge the help I received from Phil Callister who gave me tutorials on reduce, map, sort, variable scope, and function parameters/arguments. He also showed me the shorthand notation of ? : for if/else statements. Nifty!

##### For this class assignment a Table of Contents, Installation Instructions, Usage Information, Credits, License Information, Badges, Features, and Tests are not necessary but I'd like to acknowledge that those would be included here when pertinent.
